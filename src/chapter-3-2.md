Machine learning technologies can provide significant benefits for optimizing budgeting processes and implementing more accurate forecasting models. In this chapter, we will discuss the use of machine learning for creating and managing budgets.

Understanding Budgeting
-----------------------

Budgeting involves creating and managing a financial plan that outlines an individual's income, expenses, and savings goals over a specific period. This enables individuals to allocate their resources effectively, reduce unnecessary expenses, and achieve their financial goals.

However, manual budgeting can be challenging to maintain and may not account for unexpected events or changes in market conditions.
